/**
 * The components intended be to responsive to mouse events must implement this
 * interface. When a mouse event is received, it can be marked as unhandled by
 * returning false, so that the event can be passed to another component. This
 * feature is mainly used by free-shape (or non-rectangular) components.
 * Unimplemented methods should return true to prevent a backward component from
 * receiving the events it is not supposed to receive.
