## Project Description
We will develop a turn-based multiplayer 2D game involving tank battle. We inspired from a flash game named “Tanks, The Game”. There can be 2 to 4 players in a game some of which can be controlled by CPU. In the game, tanks are destroying each other with numerous kinds of bombs and the last-standing one wins. Tanks move and fire according to the specified fire power and angle which results in a projectile motion of the bomb. There are several types of bombs and power-ups each of which has different effects. For example, some bombs split into explosive pieces when they hit the target while some bombs differ from each other by just blast region. Bombs are acquired by in-game coins and a purchase uses-up one turn. Coins are gained in the result of a successful hit to the target and the gain is directly proportional to the damage given. Power-ups fall from the sky and can be obtained during the game by picking up from the ground or by shooting at them. Some power-ups are fire hint that traces the projectile of the bomb before firing it, speed boost, healing, air strike and teleport. The game physics resembles the real world by including gravity and wind. The terrain is re-shaped by explosions which limits the movement capability of tanks along with other obstacles. Fuel, for example, deteriorates by movement that eventually makes the tanks unable to move. The target platform of the project is Adobe Flash and ActionScript for coding. As alternatives, we think Java SE and Python (Web) for the target platform.
